# A simple hierarchical question template for deciding if a house is worth to 
# buy. This is a simplified decision template modified from a post 
# https://origin.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/7-questions-buying-home-1.aspx
# Changes include:
#  - Personalized questions are ignored, e.g. "Do you have the paperwork for 
#    the mechanical systems?"
#  - Coreference of the pronouns are resolved by adding varable names.
