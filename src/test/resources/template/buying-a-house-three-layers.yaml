# A simple hierarchical question template for deciding if a house is worth to 
# buy. This extends the two-layer question hierarchy from 
# buying-a-house-two-layers.yaml.
# Changes include:
#  - Personalized questions are ignored, e.g. "Do you have the paperwork for 
#    the mechanical systems?"
#  - Coreference of the pronouns are resolved by adding varable names.
